# arp-spoof
Project:An automated approach for preventing ARP spoofing attack using static ARP entries

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol for mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical
machine address (MAC) that is recognized in the local network. ARP is a stateless protocol, so it is vulnerable to
certain threats making it less reliable. ARP spoofing is the most dangerous attack that poses a threat to LANs. ARP
Spoofing is the technique used to maliciously influence the contents of the ARP cache on a local network host. This
attack may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on LAN, modify the traffic or stop the traffic altogether. This
attack may be used to launch either Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or Man in the Middle attacks (MITM).
